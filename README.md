# Ultracomplex Math

**Circular, hyperbolic and parabolic geometry — united in one eight-dimensional algebra.**

A Python library by **Philipp Kolodziej** for exploring what these geometries can do together: exact rational constructions, mixed trigonometry, rotations, boosts, shears, coupled motion and projective transformations. Derivatives arise naturally from the same structure.

$$\mathcal A_K=K[i,j,\varepsilon]/(i^2+1,\;j^2-1,\;\varepsilon^2),\qquad ij=ji,\quad i\varepsilon=\varepsilon i,\quad j\varepsilon=\varepsilon j.$$

Choose numerical real coefficients (`Ultra`) or exact rational coefficients (`ExactUltra`). The mixed directions `ij`, `eps*i`, `eps*j` and `eps*i*j` are first-class parts of the same number. The goal is a coherent mathematical toolbox that brings the strengths of all three algebras into shared computations.

The [geometry inside the full union](docs/research/geometric-structure.md) explains its complete polar form, the shared structure of oscillators and optical systems, and its projective connection to a tangent quadric. It separates mathematical derivations from implemented APIs.

## Try it

Python **3.12+**. The mathematical core has **no external dependencies**. From the repository root:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -m ultracomplexmath 'exp(i*j*(1+eps))'
python -m ultracomplexmath --exact '(1/3+i+j+eps)^3' --json
```

Circular, hyperbolic and parabolic factors compose within the same number system:

```python
from ultracomplexmath import I, J, EPS, Ultra

rotation = (I * 0.6).exp()
boost = (J * 0.35).exp()
relative_phase = (I * J * 0.2).exp()
v = Ultra(real=0.4, j=-0.2, i=0.1, ij=0.3)
shear = (EPS * v).exp()
value = 2 * rotation * boost * relative_phase * shear
assert value.isclose(2 * (I * 0.6 + J * 0.35 + I * J * 0.2 + EPS * v).exp())
```

Exact geometry uses the same algebraic laws without rounding coefficients:

```python
from fractions import Fraction as F
from ultracomplexmath import CIRCULAR, QI, QJ, QEPS, QONE, evaluate_exact

rotation = CIRCULAR.cayley(F(1, 2))
assert rotation == CIRCULAR.exact(F(3, 5), F(4, 5))
x = QONE + QI / 3 + QJ / 7 + QEPS / 11
assert x * x.inverse() == QONE
assert evaluate_exact("0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3") == 0 * QONE
```

Install plotting with `python -m pip install -e '.[plot]'`. Run `ultracomplex-gui --view domain --formula 'cos(x)'` for an editable desktop explorer. See [setup and examples](docs/getting-started.md) for other platforms and views.

## What is available

| Area | Implemented | Important boundary / next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scalar arithmetic | Full eight-component numerical and rational arithmetic; integer powers; inverses | Zero divisors have no inverse; rational coefficients do not include irrational results |
| Functions and calculus | Numerical elementary/inverse functions, logarithm branches, first variations, intensity and phase derivatives | Stable small-component evaluation is complete for neither all functions nor all scales; general higher-derivative API is open |
| Exact mathematics | Fraction formulas/JSON, matrices, complete linear solution families, polynomial arithmetic and Hermite interpolation | General rational powers, symbolic algebraic numbers and modular hypercomplex coefficients remain open |
| Geometry | Intrinsic planar metrics/sectors, exact Cayley isometries, Euclidean predicates and intersections | General 3D poses, constraint systems and conic intersections need further work |
| Transformations | Noncommuting `ModeOperator`, Möbius maps, unimodular projective points and mixed charts | Continuous matrix functions and automatic chart continuation are research priorities |
| Applications | Tested wave, robotics, interference, root-basin and coupled-motion examples | These are specified models and demonstrations, not full engineering solvers |

The ambition is broad; operation domains remain explicit. There is no compatible field structure or total order on the whole algebra. See the [mathematical foundation](docs/mathematics.md), [operation atlas](docs/research/operations.md) and [prioritized gaps](docs/research/roadmap.md).

## Where next?

The strongest next projects are **complete polar and singular geometry**, **continuous circular–hyperbolic–parabolic dynamics**, **exact geometric constraints** and **optical/projective geometry**. The [research review](docs/research/README.md) compares all seven nonempty combinations of the three base algebras, names missing functionality and gives acceptance criteria. Reliable derivatives remain part of this toolkit, alongside the geometries themselves.
