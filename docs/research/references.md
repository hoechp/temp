# Sources and evidence

[Agenda](README.md) · [Experiments](experiments.md) · [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

Sources checked for the renewed review and geometric follow-up on 2026-10-03–04 (UTC). Established background is separate from project derivations, implementation findings and proposals. This is a focused feasibility review, not an exhaustive novelty search.

The [implemented applications](../gallery/applications.md) also cite their own physical-model sources. References support only the background they discuss; actual package behavior is checked locally.

## Project-specific derivations

The seven subalgebras, unit criterion and epsilon ideal follow from the defining relations. This review additionally derives the bicomplex extraction sign, Cayley symplectic/quadratic identities, transfer/Riccati correspondence and characteristic-two presentation. Root tangent equations and limits on order, norms and rational closure follow similarly. These are direct calculations, not novelty claims.

The [geometric follow-up](geometric-structure.md) supplies explicit derivations of the full polar factorization and phase lattice, real 2×2 classification, finite shear, optical-cell transition and the projective tangent-quadric identification. It states the scalar/operator distinction and real-structure assumptions. These arguments supply the general conclusions; bounded numerical and exact examples check specified calculations rather than proving a global theorem by sampling.

Checked-in figure reports describe their full render datasets; routine CI checks the models without regenerating all assets. New probes record version/source context. Tests, lint, formatting, typing, documentation checks, probes and builds protect this release. Their success does not imply that every proposed feature exists or every numerical corner case has been eliminated.
